# Java Loader - Common
A java code streaming platform which connects to a custom PHP panel which lets you in realtime upload, update and edit your program. Created so I could easily throw a app up without having to obfuscate it (even though it is not a replacement for obfuscation) or having to throw up a auto updater for each project. This is completely automated.
